# Task2
Hello everyone Machine leaning ,Deep Learning is use for face recognition as i have did with MobileNet

# What is Machine Learning ?
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

# Task We have to perform
1.  First of all we have to load dataset ou can use ImageNet for it . In my case ,I am using my    own code which using cv2 module to click image 100 time for training , 0 time for testing.

2.  MobileNet which is using imagenet weights behind and also we are freezing all the layers of model except 4 layers, so that we don't have to train full model again and again if new image comes. Model contains total of 86 layers and we are making them false ( Freezing them ).
